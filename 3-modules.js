//MODULES IN NODE
// Modules = Encapsulated code(Only show the code that you want to show.)
//As node using Common JS, every file in node is a module. Hence whatever stuff is done with the modules, it is supported by inbuilt functions and nothing else as third party.
//Splitting your code into multiple modules for better code efficiency.

// import names, { Peter, John } from "./4-names";
// import sayHi from "./5-utils";
// import personData from "./6-alternative-syntax";
// console.log(names);
// console.log(personData);
// import "./7-mind-grenades";

//The module mind-grenades say that as long as you invoke the function inside of that particular module, you need not to invoke here in app.js and also you need not to make a new variable and console.log it. You can simply use the require global variable and you're good to go.

// sayHi(Harsh);
// sayHi(Peter);
// sayHi(John);
